  This is the planning roadmap for the [uroflavin/roadmap](https://github.com/uroflavin/roadmap) project. 
  It acts as both the plan for implementing this tool as well as a demonstration of what a roadmap might look like.

# The timeline allows us to highlight important dates on our road map. These are intentionally separated
# from the stages as it is expected that the delivery of stages themselves occur based on their dependencies
# and that the specific delivery dates may shift as a result.

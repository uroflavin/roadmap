# Roadmap Script

This script is used for creating and validating roadmap files. It uses YAML for reading and writing roadmap files, JSON for reading and writing JSON files, and jsonschema for validating JSON data against a schema. It also uses the os module for interacting with the operating system, argparse for writing user-friendly command-line interfaces, and shutil for high-level file operations.

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Before running the script, you should set up a virtual environment. This helps to keep the dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python environments for them. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `virtualenv` package:
    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment. You can name the environment anything you like. Here we name it `env`:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/project/directory
    virtualenv env
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows, run: `env\Scripts\activate`
    - On Unix or MacOS, run: `source env/bin/activate`

4. Once the virtual environment is activated, the name of your virtual environment will appear on left side of terminal.

## Generate clean requirements.txt

pipreqs helps you create lean and accurate requirements.txt files for your Python projects. Unlike pip freeze, it analyzes your code to identify only the packages you actually use, preventing bloat and unnecessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install pipreqs
# Simply run pipreqs in your project directory:
pipreqs
```

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/

**Note** 
There is a known bug in pipreqs which is causing UnicodeError.

see https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs/issues/214

To prevent this, use the good old way with pip freeze (as mentioned in the [comment](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs/issues/214#issuecomment-1903770050) )

```bash
# run inside project directory
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
## Installing Dependencies

The dependencies of the script are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. After activating the virtual environment, you can use the following command to install these dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Parameters
--roadmap-file: This parameter is used to specify the path to the roadmap YAML file that you want to read. The function read_roadmap_definition is used to read this file. If the file is not readable, an error will be logged and None will be returned.

--output-dir: This parameter is used to specify the path to the folder where the output of the roadmap.py script will be stored. The function create_output_folder is used to create this folder if it does not exist. If the folder is not writable, an error will be logged and False will be returned.

## Usage
You can run the script from the command line as follows:

```bash
python script.py --roadmap-file path/to/roadmap.yml --output-dir path/to/output/folder
python roadmap.py --roadmap-file examples/roadmap.yml --output-dir dist
```

Please replace path/to/roadmap.yml with the path to your roadmap YAML file and path/to/output/folder with the path to your output folder.

## Docker Image for the script

### Dockerfile

* Create a text file named `Dockerfile` (no extension) in the same directory as your script.
* Define the image:

```dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev as builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt --user

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest

WORKDIR /app

# Make sure you update Python version in path
COPY --from=builder /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages

COPY helloworld.py .

ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "/app/helloworld.py" ]
```

### Build Docker Image

Utilize the docker build command to construct the image:
```Bash
docker build -t roadmap_img .
```

Save the docker image to the 'dist' folder:
```Bash
docker save roadmap_img > dist/roadmap_img.tar
```

### Execute Docker Image

Run the created image using docker run:

```Bash
docker run -v $PWD/.:/app/working --rm roadmap_img --roadmap-file /app/working/examples/roadmap.yml  --output-dir /app/working/dist
```

* -v $PWD/.:/app/working: This mounts a volume, making a local directory accessible within the container.
* --rm: Automatically removes the container once it exits, keeping your system clean.
* roadmap_img: Specifies the image to use for creating the container. In this case, it's assumed that an image named "roadmap_img" exists locally.
* --roadmap-file /app/working/examples/roadmap.yml: This passes a command-line argument to the application within the container, indicating the path to the "roadmap.yml" file to be processed. The path is relative to the container's filesystem.
* --output-dir /app/working/dist: This provides another argument to the application, specifying the output directory where generated files or results should be placed. Again, the path is relative to the container's filesystem.

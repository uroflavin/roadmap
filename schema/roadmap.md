Not all aspects of roadmap are currently supported.
  - **`weighted_shortest_job_first`** *(['number', 'null'])*: A value between 0 (lowest) and 30 (highest), describing, the weighet shortest job first size (according to docs/wsjf.md).
If weighted_shortest_job_first is NULL weighted_shortest_job_first is calculated during processing, if all criteria of calculation are meet.
WSJF is a prioritization method that helps to identify the greatest possible value of a planned result in relation to its effort.
All Dimension are normally given independently
WSJF = CoD(Cost of Delay) / Job Size
CoD is: (user_business_value + time_criticality +  opportunity_or_risk)
In Order to calculate, we need all of them. Minimum: `0.0`. Maximum: `30.0`. Default: `null`.
  - **`cost_of_delay`** *(['integer', 'null'])*: A value between 0 (lowest) and 30 (highest), describing a measurement of the economic value of a job over time.
According to docs/wsjf.md CoD is calculated using user_business_value + time_criticality + opportunity_enablement_or_risk_reduction
If cost_of_delay is NULL cost_of_delay is calculated during processing, if all criteria are given and have values >= 0. Minimum: `0`. Maximum: `30`. Default: `null`.
  - **`user_business_value`** *(['integer', 'null'])*: A value between 0 (lowest) and 10 (highest), describing, how much the customer (user value) or the company (business value) benefits from the result. Minimum: `0`. Maximum: `10`. Default: `null`.
  - **`time_criticality`** *(['integer', 'null'])*: A value between 0 (lowest) and 10 (highest), describing, how time critical the item ist. E.g. are there fixed deadlines for certain results, e.g. because there are assurances to partners or customers, contractual agreements or legal deadlines? Is there a risk that the value can no longer be achieved if the deadline is not met? Will a possible completion in a few months still have the same value as today? Minimum: `0`. Maximum: `10`. Default: `null`.
  - **`opportunity_enablement_or_risk_reduction`** *(['integer', 'null'])*: A value between 0 (lowest) and 10 (highest), describing if there is any opportunity enablement or risk reduction by achiving this item. E.g. By achieving the result, are we building up certain technical or specialist skills from which we will benefit later in the implementation or which will allow us to achieve certain later results more easily or at all? Are there risks that are minimized by achieving a certain result? Minimum: `0`. Maximum: `10`. Default: `null`.
  - **`jobsize`** *(['integer', 'null'])*: A value between 1 (shortest) and 10 (longest), describing, the approximation of the expected effort or statement about how long it takes to deliver the value for a delivery or result.
If you really need a Jobsize of 0, something went wrong.. Minimum: `1`. Maximum: `10`. Default: `null`.

  Examples:
  ```yaml
  $comment: 'Item with a wsjf of 3: ((1 + 1+ 1) / 1) - mid ranked'
  cost_of_delay: 3
  jobsize: 1
  opportunity_enablement_or_risk_reduction: 1
  time_criticality: 1

  cost_of_delay: 12
  jobsize: 1
  opportunity_enablement_or_risk_reduction: 1
  time_criticality: 1
  user_business_value: 10
  weighted_shortest_job_first: 12
  ```

  ```yaml
  $comment: 'Item with a wsjf of 1.2: ((10 + 1+ 1) / 10) -> ranked low'
  cost_of_delay: 12
  jobsize: 10
  opportunity_enablement_or_risk_reduction: 1
  time_criticality: 1
  user_business_value: 10

BREAKING CHANGE: csv file structure changed from element structure to a key-value list

### Added

#### Feature #85: add WSJF parameters to reflect planned value and work and to enable prioritization

- documentation: added description for wsjf into docs/wsjf.md
- feat(schema): added wsjf to schema/roadmap.json
- feat(tests): put some fake data to tests/roadmap.yml
  calculated md5 and modified test_roadmap.py
- ref: ignore SameFileError while copy logo file 
- ref: add some debug info for args
- fix: allow jobsize range from 1...10 to prevent division by zero
- feat(tests): add testcase for calculate_cost_of_delay
- feat(core): add calculate_cost_of_delay
- feat(tests): add testcase for calculate_weighted_shortest_job_first
- feat(core): add calculate_weighted_shortest_job_first
- feat(tests): add testcase for calculate_wsjf_quantifiers_for_element_items
- feat(core): add calculate_wsjf_quantifiers_for_element_items
- feat(html): create a prototype for displaying wsjf and quantifier information in html template
  used icons from https://www.streamlinehq.com/ licenced under CC 4.0
- feat(core): changed wsjf into a more generall approach of using quantifiers in schema.roadmap.json
  changed documentation
  changed tests
  changed implementation
  changed html-prototype
- feat(html): base64 encode referenced icons in html template for offline use
  used https://www.base64-image.de/ as encoder
  only in html-prototype
- documentation: add wjsf and quantifiers to README and link to docs/wsjf.md
- feat(html): css variables and some more mods in prototype for quantifiers for better look
- fix(core): wrong function call during processing
- feat(core): do some postprocessing to enable skipping calculated elements
  postprocessing is using skip-items from preprocessing, we just do it twice
- feat(example): put some data to examples/roadmap.yml to display feature in the examples
- ref(test): put precondition check in separate testcase
- feat(core): support skip-items for quantifiers
- feat(html): add quantifiers to html template
  put some documentation and skip-item examples
- feat(core): added logic to make a key-value list from roadmap structure
  ref(test/core): function behaviours were refactored to be more compliant with the raise error concept

  there are two functions added to core: 
  - get_key_value_list() is capable of creating a key value list, having keys with optional index identifier
  - get_filtered_key_value_list() is capable to filter the list using key identifiers like in skip_items, just for the opposite
  
  get_key_value_list() will be used to refactor csv-export. 
  csv export will become a breaking change, because i re-arrange to just use key-value
  the advantage is, that every roadmap item could be exported, even the currently unknown items
  and the export will be much more future proof

  In addition test_roadmap.py and some function behavoiurs were refactored to be more compliant with raising error.
- fix(core): remove_element() failed with KeyError
  added a test to covers this problem
- feat(csv/core)!: add quantifiers to csv template and put project as a key-value-list under project['as_list]' for use in templates
  BREAKING CHANGE: csv file structure changed from element structure to a key-value list
- feat(markdown): add quantifiers to markdown template
- ref(prototype): got css from html template for compatibiltiy
- ref(prototype): moved css in separete file
- documentation(tech): known bug in pipreqs
- feat(dev): added rebuild of requirements as pre-commit
- feat(dev): removed rebuild of requirements as pre-commit
  needs more research work, pip must run in venv
- documentation: make a review to docs and roadmap examples

minor enhancements and simply test whether it works
feat: added Dockerfile to create images

This conditional statement if name == "main": ensures that the main function is only called when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module elsewhere (e.g. in unit tests).

A Todo is something which could be used to clarify a roadmap item, e.g. a open point to discuss a milestone.

it is rendered in html and markdown templates

    - milestones are something like a timeline 
    the deliverables of a milestone are then something like a list (each item must be done to reach milestone, no matter how)
    - objectives are something like a list
    and keyresults of an objective are something like a timeline (order matter: each keyresult follows another)

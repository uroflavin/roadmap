title: 'Roadmap for roadmap.py'
description: |
  This is the planning roadmap for the [uroflavin/roadmap](https://github.com/uroflavin/roadmap) project. 
  It acts as both the plan for implementing this tool as well as a demonstration of what a roadmap might look like.

  One good example is this roadmap itself. 
  What to-do and what is already done to implement roadmap.py can you see in this picture.

  One of the things you'll immediately notice about this file is that it uses *Markdown* for formatting of text and is designed around a structured YAML schema. 
  The goal is to make this as easy as possible for humans to read and reason about, while also enabling powerful visualizations to be generated based on the content.

# and that the specific delivery dates may shift as a result.

objectives:
  - title: We provide a single, universal, schema for high-level planning
    description: | 
      The goal of this project is, primarily, to provide a single schema that can be used by different teams to describe the work they are doing and their future intentions. 
      The usefulness and applicability of this schema to real-world problem domains will determine whether anything else we do here is of value.

  - title: We provide official tooling for most common use cases
    description: |
      While the goal of having a single unified schema for planning is that it enables the development of tools that automate various aspects of planning, most teams are not going to adopt this if the fundamentals aren't already solved for them. 
      This includes things like being able to visualize your road map in common formats, validating it against the schema etc.

        To render some progress in your favorite tool ;-) we should be able to generate some csv out of roadmap.yml-milestone and deliverables.
        CSV is limited capable for exporting everything, so this would be a good first step towards Roadmap als XLS-File.

  - title: We have exceptional documentation
    description: |
      Adoption of something intended to make planning easier is only going to be successful if it is easy to use, and a critical part of that is great documentation. 
      Our goal is that someone with no familiarity with our tooling can ramp up and have an initial road map ready for use within only a few minutes.

    title: Design and Planning
    description: |
      The design and planning stage is where we're figuring out how this project should work and, broadly, what kind of information we want to show on our road maps.
      We should do something for the [roadmap](https://github.com/uroflavin/roadmap), just to let us know, if the design is broken.

  - title: Web Renderer
    description: |
      GraphViz is great, but being able to see things like the description of your deliverables and their current state is something that most users are probably going to find quite useful. 
      Pair that with a need to make tinkering and experimentation easy and there are few things better than an interactive website to show your road map.
      The goal here is to produce something which is easy and pleasurable to use, which shows your road map in a format which can be understood and makes interacting with it as low-fuss as possible.

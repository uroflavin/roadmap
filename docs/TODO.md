# This is a list of todos and ideas

This list is a scratchpad during development of a new features to break down some work into smaller parts.

### TODOS
- [ ] add hillcharts for visual progress 
      you can enable hillchart-tracking by applying "progress"-tag to a deliverable
      every tagged item from a milestone will then be tracked as a hillchart-item 

- [ ] add involved teams
      involved teams are identified by their tag

- [ ] add template for `releases` (schema and model support exist, but no template renders release data)

- [ ] kanban deliverables: also show deliverables from objective-milestones (currently only project.milestones are iterated)

## Reminder Notes
The function get_key_value_list() contains a lot of the logic to refactor remove_element().

Markdown Template needs refactoring. There are a bunch of empty lines. looks terrible in the md file, but renders okayish.
